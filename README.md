## When did you last change your toothbrush?

Do you remember?

It’s recommended you replace your toothbrush every 3 months. Thats a long time to remember. Why not have an app you can check, so you don’t forget?

## Usage

Hit the button when you change your brush. The next time you find yourself wondering when you last changed your brush, check back and see how many days until you need a new brush.

Add the app to your home screen to help you remember to check or add to favourites/bookmark in the browser.

## About the design

They say design for problems and do one thing well. The solution to this specific problem is how reToothbrush app was inspired.

If you are interested in the design and implementation of the app, read the post [reToothbrush App](https://www.paulfosterdesign.co.uk/blog/retoothbrush-app/) over on my personal site.
